                Sometimes we don't start because we're waiting to be ready. But i've come to learn that readiness is a myth. You build confidence through action-not before it.

                My life right now is a mix of many things: creating database, rearing chickens, gardening, studying forex, and now- writing.It sound like a lot, but it's all connected. 
                These are no just tasks. They are blocks in the fundation I'm building, slowly, honestly, and with full intetion.

                There are days I want to pause. Days I feel overwhelmed. Days I dont see results. But deep down, I know this is the path. I am not rushing. I am documenting. Learning. 
                Growing. Believing in the future I am Building.

            <p>This blog is where i'll reflect, share my steps, and maybe, inspire someone else who's walking through their own chaos with quiet dream in their heart</p>
            <p>This is my beginning. Thank you for being here</p>
