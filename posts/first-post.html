            <h2>Starting from scratch: Why I Chose to Blog</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Posted on April 24, 2025</p>
            <p>
                I've always believed in doing things step by step. Whether it's gardening, chickens, forex,or databases-everyhing I do comes from the desire to learn, build, and grow something real.
            </p>
            <p>
                This blog is my new space. A way to document my journey, track my progress, share insights, and recollect ideas that may one day shape a book.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't claim to have it all figured out, but I'm walking the path. If you're also building from scratch, welcome. Let's grow together.
