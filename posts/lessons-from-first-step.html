                Starting something new can feel scary. I used to wait for the "perfect time", but I learned the most mportant lessons when 
                I finally took that first step.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Lesson 1: Clarity Comes from Action</strong>,  You can't plan your way to perfection. It's only by moving forward, 
                even clumsily that you figure out what works and what doesn't.</p>
            <p><strong>Lesson 2: Corage is Built, Not Given</strong>,  I didn't feel brave at first. But every small action added up, building confidence 
                I never knew I had.</p>
            <p><strong>Lesson 3: Progress Is Invisible Until It Isn't</strong>,
                Some days felt slow. Some felt pointless. But looking back, every tiny effort connected into real growth - growth I couldn't see in the moment.</p>
            <p>Taking the first step wasn't easy, but it changed everything. The fear shrank. The dream grew. And the journey became real.</p> 
            <p><strong>If you're waiting for a sign, this is it. Start now - your future self will thank you.</strong></p>
